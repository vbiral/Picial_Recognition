# Notebook files
## What's inside the files?
Here we have a folder that contains the code in .py extension, and a file that contains the notebook of the project.

## But what's this .xml and .yml files?
This files contains, respectively, the facial recognition and the trained file that contains the matrix of difference faces, (this description could be wrong, i recommend that you study the EngenFace, Fisher and LBPH training methods to know more precisaly what this files do).
